# richtig pferd - Password Generator

## About

**richtig pferd** is a password generator that creates passwords which are easy to remember but hard to guess. This tool operates entirely within your browser, ensuring that no data is transferred to any server. The project is inspired by the [XKCD Comic "Password Strength"](https://xkcd.com/936/).

## How It Works

To generate secure passwords, **richtig pferd** randomly selects words from a [word list](https://richtigpferd.pw/wordlist.txt) containing over 25,000 German words, including nouns, verbs, and adjectives. These words are randomly combined to form the password.

## Word Sources

The words are sourced from [GitHub - AlleDeutschenWoerter](https://github.com/cpos/AlleDeutschenWoerter).
